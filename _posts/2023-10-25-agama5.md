We are aware that the time between Agama releases is usually too long. Recently, we committed to
increase the frequency, although it means having smaller releases. You know, ["release early,
release often"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often).

Agama 5 includes some changes we have been working on for some time, like a translated web interface
or a software patterns selector. Additionally, it introduces a change in the storage area to not
reuse pre-existing swap partitions. And last but not least, now you can boot Agama Live via PXE.

## Translated web interface {#i18n}

Until now, Agama web interface was only available in English. However, this new release allows you
to select a different language and it is now available in another four languages: Dutch, Japanese,
Spanish and Swedish. Kudos to [Natasha Ament](https://l10n.opensuse.org/user/Stacheldrahtje/),
[Yasuhiko Kamata](https://l10n.opensuse.org/user/YasuhikoKamata/), [Victor
hck](https://l10n.opensuse.org/user/VictorHck/) and [Luna
Jernberg](https://l10n.opensuse.org/user/LunaJernbergc15bd25a134943af/) for this first round
of translations. Much appreciated!

If you are interested, please, consider helping with the translations. The [openSUSE localization
guide](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Localization_guide) might be a good starting point. :wink:

You can check the pull request [#796](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/796) if you are
interested in the technical details.

Bear in mind that selecting a different language does not affect the system you are
installing. For that matter, we have started to work on a better "Localization" page that will allow
selecting a language, a keyboard layout and a timezone for the system to install.

## Patterns selection {#patterns-selection}

An important feature that we have been postponing for some time is customizing the software
selection. We do not want to bring back complex and specific concepts, like system roles, so we
decided to start with a prototype that shows the list of available software patterns.

Agama 5 ships a new software patterns selector, as shown in the screenshot below, although it is
still a work in progress. However, it is even more important the [discussion we have
opened](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/PH7R3Q36KUBBBV4COQ5ZLDCTJNODHC6N/)
about this topic in the [openSUSE Factory mailing
list](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/). Please do not hesitate
to join if you have anything to say.

Technical details? You can find them in [#792](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/792),
[#762](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/762),
[#770](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/770) and
[#772](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/772).

## Do not reuse pre-existing swap partitions {#swap}

When proposing a storage layout, Agama reuses pre-existing swap partitions. This behavior was
introduced in YaST just for backward compatibility with old versions and was inherited by Agama.
However, we decided that Agama should stop doing this because it is confusing. Now, pre-existing
swap partitions are not reused.

Check [#806](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/806) for further details and screenshots.

## Booting via PXE

Since the earlier releases of Agama Live, it became clear that we needed a way to boot the installer
using PXE. Recently, we started to build the images you need for that. The `agama-live` package
contains [some
notes](https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/systemsmanagement:Agama:Devel/agama-live/README.pxe?expand=1)
about how to grab them from [openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/).

This feature relies on [Kiwi](https://osinside.github.io/kiwi/), so it can be used by anyone who
commits to create a real installation media based on Agama in the future. After all, Agama Live was
built for demonstration purposes.

## Other changes {#misc}

* Add a label in the storage section to indicate whether a Btrfs system will be transactional
  ([#789](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/789)).
* Set more restrictive permissions to the archive generated by the `agama logs store` command
([#812](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/812)).
* Update to [Patternfly](https://www.patternfly.org/) 5.1
  ([#800](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/800)).

## Trying Agama 5 {#download}

The best way to try Agama is to download one of the two variants (ALP or openSUSE) of the [Agama
Live devel
ISO](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Agama:/Devel/images/iso/). This
image is built in the [systemsmanagement:Agama:Devel OBS
project](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/systemsmanagement:Agama:Devel/agama-live) and is
updated each time we release a new version.

Are you interested in the bleeding edge? The ISO in the [systemsmanagement:Agama:Staging OBS
project](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/systemsmanagement:Agama:Staging/agama-live) is for
you because it is built automatically from the code on [Agama's Git
repository](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama).

## What's next {#future}

Agama 6 is already under development and we expect to have another version ready by the end of
November. For that release, we expect more changes in the internationalization area, support for the
SUSE Customer Center and the possibility of selecting how to make space for your new system.
Additionally, we are working on making it easier to tweak Agama's configuration.

We appreciate opinions and feedback. Feel free to contact the YaST team at the [YaST Development
mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/yast-devel@lists.opensuse.org/), our `#yast`
channel at [Libera.chat](https://libera.chat/) or even the [Agama project at
GitHub](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama).

Stay tunned!
