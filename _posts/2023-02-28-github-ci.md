As D-Installer consist of several components like dbus backend, CLI or web frontend,
we see a need for test ideally in CI that each component can properly start and
communicate each other. For it we use a testing framework and more importantly
github CI where we need systemd container which in the end is not trivial.
In following paragraphs we would like to share with you how we did it so
anyone of you can inspire from it or use it for your own project.

## Testing Container

Lets start with container. We created in OBS testing container that includes what is needed for
backend and frontend. During iteration we find that we depends on Network Manager and network
manager works really tightly with systemd and also to debug it we need journal that also does
not work without systemd. So we ends up with creating container that contain systemd.

Such container has several restrictions like that first process has to be systemd init.

## Github CI

When asking uncle Google how to run such systemd container on github CI it returns nothing relevant.
There was also hint to use podman for such container due to its advanced support for it
( `--systemd` option which is by default true ). But for use podman majority of answers suggest
self-hosting workers, which is not what we want.

Simple running of systemd container on github ci does not work as github overwrite entry point
to tail -f, so systemd is not the first process. But then we notice that on github hosted ubuntu
VM there is also podman preinstalled. And final idea how to solve it emerges and works for us.

## Github CI, Podman and Systemd Container

So idea is simple to run podman as steps in github CI and use our systemd container. We do not define
container keyword at all and run it manually. Each step is encapsulated in `podman container exec`.

Example config can look like:

```
  integration-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:

    - name: Git Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: start container
      run: podman run --privileged --detach --name dinstaller --ipc=host -v .:/checkout registry.opensuse.org/yast/head/containers/containers_tumbleweed/opensuse/dinstaller-testing:latest

    - name: show journal
      run:  podman exec dinstaller journalctl -b
```

This simple snippet do checkout of github repo, start container and then print content of
journal. Of course real testing of container is in front of you, but you already have
running systemd container and can inspect logs from it.

## Remaining Issues

For integration testing of dinstaller we still facing some issues.

* *Different kernel* on ubuntu latest is different kernel and we e.g. face issue that device mapper
  kernel module is missing there.
* *Restricted permissions*. Not all actions even in privileged container is possible, but it seems
  so far we are not much limited with it.
* *Cannot test whole installation* as whole installation is long and we do not want to overwrite
  host VM we cannot do full end to end testing of whole installation as part of each github pull
  request. Good news is that SUSE/openSUSE has great tool for testing installation/running system
  called openQA and we are discussing how to incorporate dinstaller with its test into it.
