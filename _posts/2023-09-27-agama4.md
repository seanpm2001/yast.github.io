After publishing Agama 3 a month ago, it is time for a new release. Among other things, this new
version fixes several issues in the startup process, allows the use of a network proxy, adds
(partial) support for IPv6, includes a few improvements in the web UI and features a new tool to
extract Agama-related logs.

But as important as those changes, we did some non-user visible work that will serve as the base
for other features, like proper i18n support and more flexible storage management. Some of those
features will land sooner than later, but meanwhile, let's focus on what Agama 4 brings.

## Agama startup issues

Our QA team is testing Agama through several scenarios and in different architectures. Those tests
helped identify some issues with Agama's startup process: D-Bus activation errors, time-outs and
even potential crashes.

Working closely with QA, we have identified and (hopefully) fixed most of those problems. In a
nutshell, you should not see the "Cannot connect to D-Bus" error message anymore. And if that's not
the case, please open a [bug report](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/) attaching [the logs](#logs)
:wink:

If you are interested in the technical details, there is a bunch of fixes you might want to check:
[#729](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/729),
[#732](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/732),
[#747](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/747),
[#749](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/749),
[#753](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/753).

## Installing through a proxy {#proxy}

Many users and customers are used to deploy their systems with no direct access to Internet, just
using a proxy. So it did not come as a surprise that it was one of the most requested features.
Agama 4 includes support for [specifying a proxy](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/696) at
boot time using the option `proxy=` when the installation requires to use a HTTP(S) or FTP source.
The supported proxy URL format is: `protocol://[user[:password]@]host[:port]`.

Of course, the proxy configuration is copied to the target system at the end of the installation.

The nitty-gritty details are available in [#696](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/696) and
[#711](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/711).

## IPv6 support in the automated installation {#ipv6}

In Agama 4 it is possible to specify the IPv6 configuration when using the automated installation.
To accommodate this feature, we decided to introduce some changes in the profile definition. Here is
an example that sets up IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

```json
  "network": {
    "connections": [
      {
        "id": "Ethernet network device 1",
        "method4": "manual",
        "method6": "manual",
        "addresses": [
          "192.168.122.100/24",
          "::ffff:c0a8:7ac7/64"
        ],
        "gateway4": "192.168.122.1",
        "gateway6": "::ffff:c0a8:7a01",
        "nameservers": [
          "192.168.122.1",
          "2001:4860:4860::8888"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```

## Matching specific network devices {#network-match}

In previous versions of Agama, it was not possible specify which interface to use for a given
network connection when using the auto-installation mechanism: Agama just delegated on
NetworkManager to decide. Now you can associate a network connection with an specific interface by
using [its
name](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/blob/2b3febaa788767e4c0b70bfbbad061f9941df50c/rust/agama-lib/share/profile.schema.json#L35)
or more [complex
conditions](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/blob/2b3febaa788767e4c0b70bfbbad061f9941df50c/rust/agama-lib/share/profile.schema.json#L108-L145).
See [#723](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/723) for further details.

```json
  "network": {
    "connections": [
      {
        "id": "Ethernet network device 1",
        "method4": "auto",
        "interface": "enp1s0"
      }
    ]
  }
```

## Agama specific storage settings {#storage-settings}

Agama reads the information about the products offered for installation from a configuration
(`/etc/agama.yaml`). Such a file contains a *storage* section which indicates the options
(whether to use LVM, encryption, etc.) and the volumes (file systems) to create in the target
system.

Since both Agama and YaST use the same mechanism to calculate the storage layout (known as the
Guided Setup in YaST), the configuration for Agama was a direct translation of the YaST settings.
But althought the internal components and algorithms are the same, Agama's approach for tweaking
their behavior is actually different in several aspects from YaST. For that reason, Agama now
implements its own storage settings, making the product configuration more straightforward and
less error-prone.

This change has a direct impact in Agama's auto-installation profiles.

```jsonnet
storage: {
  bootDevice: "/dev/vda",
  lvm: true,
  encryptionPassword: "123456"
}
```
Interested in the implementation? Feel free to check:
[#721](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/721),
[#738](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/738) and
[#748](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/748).

## Better logging support {#logs}

As the project evolves and more people try Agama, we need to make the debugging process easier.
Recently, we introduced a new command that gathers all the information we need to debug the problems
you face when using Agama (similar to the venerable `save_y2logs` for YaST). Typing `agama logs
store` creates a tarball you can attach to your bug reports.

This first version ([#757](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/757)) is rather basic but we are
already working on additional features to have a pleasant debugging process :bug:.

## Polishing the web user interface {#web-ui}

Balsa Asanovic has become a regular contributor of Agama. For example, he implemented the "show
password" feature ([#750](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/750)) and improved the error
reporting in the iSCSI form ([#699](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/699)). But not only that,
he is actively involved in [our discussions](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/discussions) in
GitHub. Thank you, Balsa!

Moreover, a bug that prevented to download YaST2 logs through the web UI has been fixed
([#746](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/pull/746)).

## i18n support is coming to Agama {#i18n}

If you follow the project closely enough, you might already know that we are working on i18n
support. Many of the pieces are already in place but we did not make it for this version. However,
we trust that our next major version will feature a translated web interface. Actually, our
translators [are already working](https://l10n.opensuse.org/projects/agama/) on that.

## Trying Agama 4 {#download}

The easiest way to try Agama is to download one of the two variants (ALP or openSUSE) of the [Agama
Live devel
ISO](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Agama:/Devel/images/iso/). This
image is built in the [systemsmanagement:Agama:Devel OBS
project](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/systemsmanagement:Agama:Devel/agama-live) and is
updated each time we release a new version.

If you are interested in the bleeding edge, try the ISO in the [systemsmanagement:Agama:Staging OBS
project](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/systemsmanagement:Agama:Staging/agama-live). It is
built automatically and contains the code from [Agama's Git
repository](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama), so it might get broken occassionally.

## What to expect {#future}

We expect to be able to ship a translated Agama interface and better handling of the storage
settings in the next release. But, meanwhile, we are already working on other important features
like software patterns selection or support for the SUSE Customer Center.

Of course, we appreciate opinions and feedback. As usual, feel free to contact the YaST team at the
[YaST Development mailing
list](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/yast-devel@lists.opensuse.org/), our `#yast` channel
at [Libera.chat](https://libera.chat/) or even the [Agama project at
GitHub](https://github.com/openSUSE/agama).

Stay tuned!
